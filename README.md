## Get started

Passwordless.dev consists of three key parts:

* An open-source client side library, used by your frontend to make requests to the end-user's browser WebAuthn API and requests to the passwordless.dev APIs.
    * [JavaScript Client](https://github.com/bitwarden/passwordless-client-js): JavaScript
    * [Android Client](https://github.com/bitwarden/passwordless-android): Java, Kotlin
* A public RESTful API used to complete FIDO2 WebAuthn cryptographic exchanges with the browser.
    * [Register here](https://admin.passwordless.dev/Account/Login)
* a private RESTful API used to initiate key registrations, verify signins, and retrieve keys for end-users. This is typically your backend.

## Requirements
* Android 9+ (API 28)
